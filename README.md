Typing speed calculator in python web application
Abstract
The web-application shows what to type on screen, and calculates the time taken for typing, and application should calculate the words per minute speed of the user. The web-application also report how many letters are typed with wrong letters and without wrong letters. 

1.	Problem Statement 
When we typing for a something or journals, if we don’t have much typing speed also       typing with spelling mistakes occurs. So we can’t directly find our “word per minute” and errors while typing. So we need to calculates how much time took for typing specified numbers of words and how many errors occurred after typed, also need “word per minute”. 

2.	Proposed Solution 
Here mainly used python program to find comparing two strings of texts, that is first string is the display shown what to type, it is a single line or multi line string and also provided a text area for type the display shows the same here we types text as a second string .There is provided 3 buttons that is “START”, “SUBMIT”, “RESET”, buttons, initially browsing the server the display shows what to type and when we click on “Start” button the timer getting started we can type text in the text area and after finish the typing we can click on “Submit” button then the timer get stop and showing results of numbers of errors and non errors, wpm, accuracy, and time taken.
